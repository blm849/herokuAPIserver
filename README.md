# herokuAPIserver

A simple API server to run on Heroku without a database.

I wanted an API server to do this because I wanted a simple way to test out API calls without the hassle of setting up the database. This will save information if you pass
it but eventually it will be restarted and it loses information.

To call it, you can use software like Postman and call URIs such as http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3000/api/games

For more information on how to run it locally and then on Heroku, see https://appdividend.com/2018/04/14/how-to-deploy-nodejs-app-to-heroku/
